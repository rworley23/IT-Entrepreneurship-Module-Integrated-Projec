# IT-Entrepreneurship-Module-Integrated-Project

For this project we were tasked to explore different facets of starting our own IT business and choose the appropriate tools to complete each 
portion of the project. My group members and I conducted background research on what entrepreneurship was, what it entailed, and explored 
ideas for our own business. We were asked to complete a career and personality assessment to assist us in our business decision. As a group we had selected IT Consulting as our niche with a target market of healthcare.  Our purpose was to offer a well-rounded approach to small practice IT infrastructure and workflow that is HIPAA compliant and focused on patient safety.  After developing an idea for our business we had begun to deliberate about our business plan which included a logo, slogan, location, general revenue stream, threats/challanges, and laws we needed to familiarize ourselves of in this field. In addtion, we had to consider resources we would need to start and maintain our business. For instance, how would we raise startup capital and what resources would we need? Finally, we incorporated all of our information into a summarized powerpoint.
